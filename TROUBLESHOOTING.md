# React Hook Error - Root Cause Analysis

## Problem
Error: "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')"

## Root Cause
Google Tag Manager script was interfering with React's initialization process, causing React hooks to be called before React was properly loaded.

## Solution
1. Modified `src/main.tsx` to use `React.createElement` instead of JSX
2. Added proper timing controls to wait for external scripts (GTM) to finish loading
3. Added error handling with fallback initialization
4. Ensured React is fully available before attempting to render components

## Key Changes
- Added 50ms delay for GTM script completion
- Used `React.createElement` for more reliable rendering
- Added fallback initialization without StrictMode if needed

This ensures the page loads reliably even with external tracking scripts.
